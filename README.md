Contributing:

If you'd like to add some new locations you can get the coordinates by clicking on an area on the map with the js console open in your web browser. It will output a coordinate.

To get the most accurate location information it's important to zoom as much as you can.

All suported locations can be found here:

If you can, it's also helpful if you can look up the location on Forgotten Realms wiki and make sure the name of the location matches with what they have there so that we can pull information in to TorilMap. Not all locations will be present on the wiki, and that's okay. Even better if you can contribute over there too!

Feel free to contibute to the other repos too, it can be anything. 

Don't like the map pins I've made? Submit some new ones!
Want to add maps for a town? You can do that too!
